## 4. Data Preprocessing

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Our preprocessing approach follows industry best practices to ensure robust model performance:

**Step 1: Missing Value Handling**
```python
# No missing values detected - no imputation required
missing_check = df.isnull().sum()
print(f"Missing values: {missing_check.sum()}")  # Output: 0
```

**Step 2: Categorical Feature Encoding**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# One-hot encoding for categorical features
categorical_features = ['job', 'marital', 'education', 'default', 
                       'housing', 'loan', 'contact', 'month', 'poutcome']

encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=True)
# Input: job='admin' → Output: job_admin=1, job_blue-collar=0, ...
```

**Step 3: Numerical Feature Scaling**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Standardization (mean=0, std=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
# Input: balance=1500 → Output: balance=0.12 (standardized)
```

**Step 4: Complete Preprocessing Pipeline**
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
])
```

**Preprocessing Results:**
- **Before**: 16 original features
- **After**: 65 features (after one-hot encoding)
- **Scaling**: All numerical features standardized to mean=0, std=1
- **Encoding**: All categorical features converted to binary indicators

## 5. Experimental Setups

### Experiment 1: Synthetic → Real (Direct Test)

**Objective**: Evaluate how well models trained exclusively on synthetic data generalize to real customer behavior.

**Setup:**
- **Training Data**: 1,000,000 synthetic samples
- **Test Data**: 9,043 real customer samples (20% holdout from real dataset)
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Evaluation**: Direct performance measurement on real test data

**Why This Matters**: This experiment determines if synthetic data can substitute for real data when privacy concerns limit access to customer information, which is increasingly important in regulated industries.

### Experiment 2: Small Real Data Analysis

**Objective**: Quantify the relationship between real data quantity and model performance to determine minimum data requirements.

**Data Fractions Tested:**
- 1.0% (361 samples) - Extreme data scarcity scenario
- 5.0% (1,808 samples) - Limited pilot data
- 10.0% (3,616 samples) - Small campaign data
- 25.0% (9,042 samples) - Medium campaign data
- 50.0% (18,084 samples) - Large campaign data
- 100.0% (36,168 samples) - Full dataset

**Model**: XGBoost (best performer from Experiment 1)
**Purpose**: Establish data efficiency curves and identify the point of diminishing returns for additional data collection.

### Experiment 3: Transfer Learning

**Objective**: Assess whether pretraining on synthetic data improves performance when limited real data is available.

**Method:**
1. **Pretraining Phase**: Train model on 1,000,000 synthetic samples
2. **Fine-tuning Phase**: Continue training on small real data portions (5%, 10%, 25%)
3. **Comparison**: Compare against direct training on same real data amounts

**Transfer Learning Approach:**
- **Tree Models (XGBoost)**: Transfer optimized hyperparameters and feature engineering insights
- **Implementation**: Use synthetic-optimized model configuration as starting point for real data training

**Hypothesis**: Synthetic pretraining should provide better initialization than random parameters, especially with limited real data.
